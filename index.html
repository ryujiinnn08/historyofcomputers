            <p><em><strong>Can you imagine your life without a computer?</strong></em>
                <br>Think about all of the things you wouldn’t be able to do. Send an email or online shop, and find an answer to a question instantly. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. 
                <br>We’ve come a long way from the very first computer and even the first smartphone. But how much do you really know about their history and evolution? From floppy discs to <em><strong>artificial intelligence (AI) software</strong></em>, the Acorn to the Macintosh, let’s explore how far we’ve come.
                <br>While today we use computers for both work and play, they were actually created for an entirely different purpose.
                <br>In 1880, the population of the United States had grown so large that it took seven years to formulate the results of the U.S. Census. So, the government looked for a faster way to get the job done, which is why punch-card computers were invented, which took up an entire room. The first digital computer, known as the Pascal Machine, has its roots in the 16th century. The Pascal Machine was the first revelation in the world of computers before Charles Babbage invented the Difference engine. From assembly to binary, we have come a long way.
                <br>While that’s how the story starts, it’s certainly not where it ends. Let’s explore the history of computers.
